        <span class="faqanswer">
          The application process is organised in 3 steps: a registration, a
          technical assignment and a video interview.<br />
          First, you will need to register before the deadline on our website by
          clicking here and fill in all the relevant information we ask for.<br />
          Second, you will receive an automatic email with a link to an
          assignment. This assignment will take you around 25 hours to finish.
          Make sure to start on time! Once the assignment is done, you will have
          to submit it for review.<br />
          Finally, we will assess the quality of your techincal assignment and
          if positive, invite you for a video interview. During the interview,
          we will assess your level of English and your motivation. Students who
          are selected will receive a confirmation email after all interviews
          have been carried out. Good luck!

        <span class="faqanswer">
          Students can only develop their full potential if they have access to
          qualitative material to learn. Because not every student has the
          resources to buy a computer, we collect used computers from companies
          to borrow them for the duration of our program.<br />
          If your company has unused computers in stock, we would be incredibly
          grateful to make them useful again! Contact us via
